Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
==================================================================

##Following files are available after the download is completed:

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

##The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 


##Following are the variable used in the script run_analysis.R to perform the following:


1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


test_dataset = variable that contains the test dataset along with the corresponding activity & subject

train_dataset = variable that contains the train dataset along with the corresponding activity & subject

final_dataset = variable that has the combined data of both the test & train dataset

fnl_data_reqd = variable that has the dataset with the measurements on mean and std

fnl_dataset_actylbl = variable that has the dataset in the ordered with the detailed label names for the measurements

newdataset_mean = new dataset created with the average/mean values for each subject and activity.


##Following are the variables for which the dataset has the measurements.
